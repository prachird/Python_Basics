Regular expressions: import re

raw string in python: r'hello'

re.complie method is use to find patterns, which will return them as an variable

pattern = re.complie(r'Hello')
matches = pattern.finditer() #this finditer() will iterate through all the matches which are found my the complie method
for match in matches:
  print(match)
  
  
.  -> matches any character except new line
\d -> macthes if it is a digt(0-9)
\D -> not a digit(0-9)
\w -> word character(A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _)
\W -> not a word character
\s -> whitespace(space/tab/newline)
\S -> not a whitespace(space/tab/newline)
\b -> word boundary
\B -> not a word boundary
^  -> beginning of a string
$  -> end of a string

[] -> character set

eg. [0-9a-zA-Z] -> will match with any single digit/single character

^ within a [] denotes negation

Brackets: 
|  -> either Or
() -> Group

Quantifiers:
* -> 0 or more
+ -> 1 or more
? -> 0 or none
{1} -> exact number       eg. r'\d{3}.\d{3}.\d{4}'  --> 300.345.4532
{2-4} -> range(minimum, maximum)

Groups: to extract a specific sub-pattern from a pattern
eg. pattern = re.compile(r'([a-z][0-9]+)@(/.com)')
complete pattern is group 0, and then sub-patterns as group 1,2,......

other methods of re:
re.search()...............will search for a specific pattern, it is not iterable
re.findall()..............will just display the pattern, it is iterable
